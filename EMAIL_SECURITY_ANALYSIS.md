## DMARC Setup Instructions

**CRITICAL:** Add DMARC record to improve email deliverability and security.

### DNS Record to Add:
```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@townranker.com; ruf=mailto:dmarc-reports@townranker.com; sp=quarantine; adkim=r; aspf=r; pct=100; rf=afrf; fo=1
```

### Setup Steps:
1. Log into your DNS provider (Porkbun/Cloudflare)
2. Add new TXT record
3. Set name/subdomain: `_dmarc`
4. Set value to the record above
5. Save and wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)
6. Test with: `dig TXT _dmarc.townranker.com`

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### 1. Regular Checks
- Monitor rate limit usage via `/api/email/rate-limits`
- Check bounce statistics via `/api/email/bounces`
- Review email logs via `/api/email/logs`
- Validate configuration via `/api/email/validate`

### 2. Health Monitoring
- System health: `/api/email/health`
- Run test suite: `node scripts/test-email-system.js`
- Check DNS records periodically

### 3. Security Maintenance
- Rotate app-specific password annually
- Monitor DMARC reports when implemented
- Review and clear bounce records as needed
- Update rate limits based on usage patterns

## Performance Metrics

### Current Limits
- **Hourly Limit:** 50 emails/hour
- **Per-Minute Limit:** 5 emails/minute
- **Bounce Threshold:** 3 bounces = block
- **Cache TTL:** 10 minutes (rate limits), 24 hours (bounces)

### Recommendations for Production
- Monitor actual usage patterns
- Adjust limits based on business needs
- Implement alerting for high bounce rates
- Set up DMARC reporting email address

## OAuth2 Future Enhancement

OAuth2 infrastructure has been implemented but requires additional setup:

1. **Required Credentials:**
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (not currently set)
   - `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` (not currently set)

2. **Benefits:**
   - More secure than app passwords
   - Better integration with Google services
   - Enhanced security features

3. **Implementation:**
   - Update environment variables
   - Test OAuth2 authentication
   - Migrate from app password

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Run comprehensive email system test
node scripts/test-email-system.js rank@townranker.com

# Check email service health
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     https://townranker.com/api/email/health

# Validate DNS records
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     https://townranker.com/api/email/validate

# Get DMARC setup instructions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     https://townranker.com/api/email/dns/dmarc-recommendation
```
